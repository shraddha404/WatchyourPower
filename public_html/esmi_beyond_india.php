Many developing countries are struggling to meet the increase in demand for electricity. This increasing demand builds pressure on the existing grid network leading to outages in power supply and poor quality of supply. But most of these countries are constrained by limited resources and need to target their investments. Transparent data about power supply quality can help electricity sector stakeholders take effective action. Prayas (Energy Group) has partnered with <a href="http://wri.org/">World Resources Institute, Washington DC</a>, to pilot ESMI beyond India and to raise the visibility of ESMI and the issue of quality of supply in global forums and processes such as SE4All, Asian Development Bankâ€™s Asia Clean Energy Forum, and the Multi Tire Framework for Measuring Energy Access Initiative of the World Bank / ESMAP. Prayas (Energy Group) has supported ESMI pilots in <a href="http://www.iesr-esmi.id/">Indonesia</a>, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Kenya in partnership with organizations in respective countries.
